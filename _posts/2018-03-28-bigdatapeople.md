title: People, Big Data and Competitive Companies

As Mariana Kantor noted in the Esri Newsroom [AI Leads Corporate Data Priorities, but Worries Outweigh Progress]( https://www.esri.com/about/newsroom/publications/wherenext/business-executives-and-ai/?adumkts=branding&aduc=social&adum=external&aduSF=linkedin&aduca=m18wherenext&aduco=execs_and_AI&adut=social_team&adbsc=social_20180326_2227211&adbid=6384051703582461952&adbpl=li&adbpr=5311) March 21, 2018 post, a New Vantage Partners’ recently released annual survey, shows that 80 percent of the executives who responded fear their companies won’t move fast enough to compete with upstarts steeped in a data-driven ( data analytics, big data, and AI ) culture.

Working as a Solution Architect for Imagem, the Brazilian Esri distributor, and having many years of experience helping customer with digital transformation and solving their problems applying the science of where, is clear to me that it is fundamental we solve the Big Data problem ( a collection of datasets so large and complex that it becomes difficult to process using on-hand database management tools or traditional data processing applications ) due to move towards the data-driven culture. If you look to the other two components of this data-driven triad: Analytics an AI are only really effective in returning the investment if capable of use large datasets. 

The matter with the Big Data problem’s solution is that  it is a real culture changing.  It is much more than just adopting new tools, you have too see data in a different way, sometimes it will be against all you have learned so far and considering as best practices carved in stone.  Imagine telling to traditional DBA (Database Administrator), the Guardian of the Database Schema and Integrity, that there is no Schema anymore and that Normal Form does not apply. Now you go and tell him or her that, because NOSQL and  schema on read not schema on write his or hers Archenemy “the Developer” is now solely responsible for the entire database integrity.  Obviously it is an exaggeration, DBA are very competent and capable of changing and Data Governance still exists. But as you can see it is a cultural changing not only for data governance, DBAs and developers but to everyone in the company as well. To be capable of using real time massive datasets and analyze it with AI brings to reality what we have seen only in fiction, the company itself has to embrace the data-driven culture in all its dimensions if wants to stay competitive.

To be part of the data-driven culture every professional has to view data with a different approach. Is my opinion, that's where GIS (Geographic Information System) professionals have leverage over others IT experts.  We have been forged by Data Preparation since the beginning of our professional lives. Merging unstructured dataset of different sources of information of different systems of reference, resolution and attributes into one layer of useful information and processing humongous amounts of raster data in different formats is a regular day to a GIS professional. So, we embrace the data-driven culture and Big Data solutions as something which makes lots of sense to us, not as a cultural shock.  We have to learn new tools for sure, but the mindset is the same.

Geo Enabling is a common use of geospatial functions that re-occur across various organizational business models and 
environments, and it is a valid use of geospatial functions in traditional datasets. The same use of geospatial functions is valid for Big Data datasets as well. As GIS professionals we can Geoenable Big Data Technologies and use them as another tool on our belt, for instance: crunch dozen of millions of records using Apache Hive Geo Enabled by the [Esri Geometry API for Java](https://github.com/Esri/geometry-api-java) and  the [Spatial Framework for Hadoop](https://github.com/Esri/spatial-framework-for-hadoop) both included in [GIS Tools for Haddop](http://esri.github.io/gis-tools-for-hadoop/ ) available at Esri’s GisHub.  And if you are using ArcGIS Pro to Decision Support and Analytics feel free to check my contribution [Hadoop Toolbox](https://github.com/carloseduardotoledo/bigdata_arctoolbox/tree/master/hdfs) as well.  This is just a sample among the many possibilities of applying GIS strategies to Big Data. GeoAnalytics and Real-time Strategy are two others. Geo Enabling, Mapping, Decision Support and Analytics are examples geographic information patterns of use that have been used with traditional  datasets, that can also be applied and benefits from Big Data and data-driven approach.

As organizations explore different techniques to make sense of disparate data and move fast enough to compete with upstarts steeped in a data-driven culture, it is crucial to improve awareness of contemporary workflows and methodology and cultural data change by regularly invest in workforce development. To be part of the data-driven culture the executives who fear their companies won’t move fast enough to compete with upstarts steeped in a data-driven, they have to lead the process of change people minds, not only give them new tools, otherwise they will be using new tools with the same traditional approach.
