I’m a dedicated GIS Analyst and software developer experienced with all the stages of the
development cycle. For the last three years I’ve been working as Solutions Architect at Imagem, the Esri
Brazilian distributor, and I have more than fifteen years of experience consulting, modeling, developing
and designing solutions based on the Esri ArcGIS platform. I’m currently attending a MIT in Big Data
to leverage my GIS Analytics experience to properly gather, store, process and support data driven
business decisions with high volumes of structured and unstructured spatial and non-spatial data.
